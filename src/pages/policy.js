            Only when you in the contact form provided on our Site, subscribe to
            our newsletter, or send us an e-mail, we will optionally process the

            consent to collect a password, email address, phone number, user
            agent, and IP address. We do not store this data ourselves. The data
            is used to enable end-user authentication and facilitate end-user
            account management. It also uses user-agent strings and IP addresses
            to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
            authentication.
            <br></br>IP addresses are logged for a few weeks. Other
            authentication information is retained until you initiate deletion
            of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and
            backup systems within 180 days. To opt out of our account service

          <h2 className="static-page__ttl-roman">V. COOKIES</h2>
          <p className="static-page__txt">
            What are cookies?
            <br></br>Cookies are small files that are saved on your computer
            when you visit web pages. They contain information linked to a web
            browser and the specific website. They are saved in a specific
            folder on your hard drive. If you return to a specific website, this
            page can recognize the visitor by means of the cookie and further
            elaborate the history. A web beacon is an (often transparent)
            graphic image, usually no larger than 1 pixel, that is placed on a
            website and that is used to monitor the behavior of the user
            visiting the website.
            <br></br>Cookies are used to increase visitor-friendliness: by
            identifying visitors with a cookie, they do not always have to enter
            the same data such as login information or screen settings every
            time you visit the website.
            <br></br>Which kind of cookies exist?
            <br></br>Often a distinction is made between two large groups of
            cookies:
            <br></br> First party cookies: these cookies are created by a
            website to have the web page function better. They regulate the
            technical part of a site, such as language choice or remembering the
            products in the shopping basket in an online store. The visited
            website creates and places first party cookies.
            <br></br>Third party cookies: these cookies are created and placed
            on your computer by another (third) party than the website you
            visit. They remember the behavior of a surfer. Examples are social
            media such as Facebook or Twitter, but Google Analytics as well.
            This is the system used most to measure website visits.
            <br></br>Cookies required for the correct functioning of the Site do
            not require permission. All other cookies do.
            <br></br>Which cookies do we use?
            <br></br>We will only use first party cookies to help improve your
            user experience on the Site. We would do this by recording specific
            information about the user such as the language chosen, the pages
            visited and the duration of the visits.
            <br></br>We may offer games from third-party game distributors on
            our portal. By playing a third-party game, your Personal Data may be
            processed by the third-party game distributor (directly or through
            the use of cookies or similar technology). Please note that if you
            choose to play a third-party game, you are playing that game in the
            environment of that game's third-party developer, over which we have
            no control.
            <br></br>Your acceptance of this Privacy Policy by using the Site,
            entails that third parties may drop cookies and/or use web beacons
            for advertising and tracking purposes.
            <br></br>Third parties might use information gathered by cookies
            and/or web beacons for the purpose of online behavioral advertising
            and/or multisite advertising. The types of information that is
            gathered by third party cookies and/or web beacons as well as the
            purpose(s) for which this information is used, are set out in the
            privacy policy of said third parties which Zeraverse.io encourages
            you to review. Zeraverse.io declines all and any liability for any
            third-party cookies or web beacons deployed by third parties for
            whatever purpose.
            <br></br>In addition, the Site also uses third party cookies such as
            cookies from Google Analytics.
            <br></br>Google Analytics is a free service by Google to collect
            statistics of websites and to represent them in detail. The website
            administrator thus has a clear view on visitor flows, traffic flows
            and page displays. This way it is possible to adapt parts of a
            website or complete websites to the behavior and interests of the
            visitors.
            <br></br>How to manage cookies?
            <br></br>You can do so by adapting your browser settings. You can
            choose to block cookies or to accept only cookies from specific
            websites.
            <br></br>Below, you will find an overview of the possibilities the
            browsers offer to manage cookies.

            you want with the slide control. You can also change this manually
            by clicking Advanced. A distinction is made between permanent direct
            cookies (first party cookies), permanent indirect cookies (third
            party cookies) and temporary cookies (session cookies). You can
            remove cookies by means of the main screen of internet options.
            <br></br>Mozilla Firefox: Open your browser. Select Privacy. Set
            Firefox to Use adapted settings for history. To switch cookies on,
            put a checkmark with Accept cookies of websites. To switch off
            cookies, remove this checkmark. Firefox also gives you the
            possibility to switch off cookies of third parties (third party
            cookies). Furthermore you can set for how long cookies can be kept.
            Click Show cookies and you can remove one or several cookies.
            <br></br>Safari: Open your browser. In Safari, cookie administration

            Preferences. Via Advanced and Cookies you can set your cookies
            settings. You also have the possibility to have new cookies removed
            automatically when you close each Internet session. Moreover, you
            can decide about each cookie that is sent to your computer. You do
            this by clicking Ask me before accepting cookies. Each time a site
            wants to save a cookie, a dialog box is displayed.

            Zeraverse.io has taken all reasonable and appropriate technical and
            organizational measures to ensure that your Personal Information is

            <br></br> At no moment in time will we directly sell or rent out
            your personal data to third parties. Occasionally we may use an

            information is handled confidentially and in a safe manner. We also
            always draw up a contract with these processors. This way the
            processor will never be allowed to use your data on its own
            initiative and your data has to be erased as soon as the processor
            has finished the assignment.
